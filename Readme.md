## About Me

I am a GenAI/AI/ML and DFT(VLSI) Engineer at Nvidia where I work on Large Language Models, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Innovative AI Engineer adept at optimizing model architectures and training techniques. Experi- enced in publishing impactful work in top-tier conferences. Proficient in Python, ML and Gen-AI Tools and Algorithms, with a strong record of problem-solving and communication skills. I got my Masters degree at the IIT Bombay in 2018.

## What I’ve been working on

- Deployed Product based on LLM i.e. perfect use-case for Hardware Engineers 
- Spearheaded research and development efforts on LLAMA, MixTrAL, and GPT - Generative AI model training techniques, enhancing their capabilities and performance.
- Submitted the latest work in ICML conference - https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00176.
- Prompt Engineering - Engineered complex prompts utilizing techniques such as Chain of Thought (CoT), CoF and SFT Tuning, resulting in significant improvements in model outputs.
- Contributed to the development of the RAG pipeline, facilitating data extraction from multiple sources while ensuring security protocols with tokens. Implemented LLM to effectively publish ranking results derived from queries.
- To optimize RAG’s application on VLSI data, focused on retraining the embedding model using self-training techniques. This initiative led to enhanced model adaptation and performance, significantly improving outcomes.
- Successfully deployed complete APIs, ensuring seamless integration with existing systems, and conducted thorough testing using Postman.
- Leading the Generic Log Analysis (GLA) project aimed at optimizing the silicon lifecycle, where I am spearheading the implementation of innovative strategies to improve efficiency. Currently strategizing a research paper on this topic to further contribute to the field.
- Conducted comprehensive research on Digital Twin Technology and Generative AI methodologies, making significant contributions to the advancement of the field. Currently leading a project focused on creating digital twins for semiconductor process optimization, actively involved in dataset develop- ment and the exploration of various optimization strategies.
- Leading a team at the Bangalore office dedicated to AI development initiatives for research and develop- ment over the past 7-8 months. Actively engaging in discussions with multiple teams to understand their challenges and explore AI-driven solutions. Collaborating across teams to enhance productivity and drive innovation.
- Engaged in resolving a regression problem aimed at identifying anomaly cases, with my team diligently working on this task.
