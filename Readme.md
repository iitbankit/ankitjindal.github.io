## About Me

I am a Senior AI/ML Manager at Apple Knowledge Platform where I work on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Prior to this I was a Senior Staff Applied Scientist and Engineering Manager at IBM Watson where I designed and developed algorithms for IBM's conversational AI product - Watson Assistant. I got my Masters degree at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University in 2014.

## What I’ve been working on

I work on the Apple Knowledge Platform which powers interactions across Siri and Spotlight. I currently work on Knowledge Graphs, Entity Linking, Question Answering and Synthetic Query Generation.

Prior to this I worked on the Natural Language Understanding components of Watson Assistant which includes intent classification, entity recognition, spellcheck and irrelevant detection across multiple languages. The algorithms are designed to be custom-trained for customers globally, deployed at scale with hundreds of thousands of models in production and serves more than 1.9% of the world’s population every month.
